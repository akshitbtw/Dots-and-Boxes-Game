# Introduction

This is an implementation of the traditional pen and paper Dots and Boxes Game, written in C language using C Graphics. Talking about the gameplay, the main
objective of this game is to create more number of boxes in order to gain high points than that
of the opponent. There are no time limits during gameplay, all you have to do is keep on joining
the lines (horizontally or vertically) to form boxes. The person to connect the 4th edge will form a box and hence, his/her initial will be written inside the box.


## Requirements

In order to run this game, you'll need the latest graphics.h header file & MingW Compiler.

Following is the command to run the .c file
```bash
g++ $fileName -o $fileNameWithoutExt -lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32 -Wno-write-strings && $dir$fileNameWithoutExt
```
