## Introduction

This is an implementation of the traditional pen and paper game, Dots and Boxes, written in the C programming language using C Graphics. The gameplay revolves around the objective of creating more boxes than the opponent in order to score higher points. There are no time limits during gameplay; the 2 players take turns connecting lines horizontally or vertically to form boxes. When a player successfully connects the fourth edge of a box, they claim that box by writing their initial inside it.

## Pre-requisites

In order to run this game, you'll need the latest graphics.h header file & MingW Compiler.

Following is the command to build & run the .c file
```bash
g++ $fileName -o $fileNameWithoutExt -lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32 -Wno-write-strings && $dir$fileNameWithoutExt
```
